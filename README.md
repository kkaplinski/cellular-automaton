# CellularAutomaton

Hi there ! 

This is first version of cellular automaton. You can check it here:

or download files and run index.html in your browser. This is clean vanilla javascript. 

How does it work ? 

Well, for now you can choose Rule between 1-255 - this is decimal representation of binary rule which is used to map pattern.
Steps input range (well I don't know if it's good name for it) represent resultion of created pattern - more steps - more new squares rendered. 

For more info I suggest to read this article:
Wolfram, S. "Statistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata." Rev. Mod. Phys. 55, 601-644, 1983.
